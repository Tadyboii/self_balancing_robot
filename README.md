# ü§ñ Self-Balancing Robot

This repository contains the design, implementation, and code for our Self-Balancing Robot project. The robot is a demonstration of dynamic stability using feedback control systems, powered by an ESP32 microcontroller and an MPU6050 sensor for precise tilt detection.

Our work aims to showcase the principles of robotics, PID control, and sensor integration in a compact, functional prototype.

## üìñ Project Overview
**üîß Objective**

To design and develop a self-balancing robot capable of maintaining an upright position dynamically by processing real-time feedback from sensors and applying corrections via motor controls.

**üìä Key Features**

    Autonomous Balancing: Implements a PID control algorithm for stability.
    Real-Time Feedback: Utilizes the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope for precise orientation and tilt detection.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
    Sensor Feedback
        The MPU6050 detects the robot's angular position and rate of change.
        Provides real-time tilt data by combining accelerometer and gyroscope readings.

    PID Control Loop
        The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) algorithm calculates the necessary motor corrections based on the tilt angle and its rate of change.
        Parameters are tuned to achieve optimal balancing performance.

    Motor Actuation
        The ESP32 sends control signals to the motor driver, which adjusts motor speeds to counteract any tilt.
